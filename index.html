        <h1>To Whom It May Concern:</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
            <p>  I’ve been given so much. I have been so privileged in my life and have inadvertently thrown away every opportunity handed to me. I am immensely grateful for them, however, I don’t regret these losses. No one deserves any more privilege than anyone else. We are all created equal and we all deserve to be able to enjoy as much of life as any other.</p>
            <p>I’m physically and emotionally drained. I’ve tried so very hard to hold myself together and every time that I begin to feel confident that I’ve found an adhesive that can bear it, there’s a sharp sting as it quickly breaks apart under the compounding weights that build themselves up inside me. I was hurting, I hurt, I will hurt. I hurt in such a cyclical nature. I find the inspiration I need to continue, grip it with all the strength I have and head steadfast with the strongest will to fight, and I do. I fucking do. I fight to my last breath, but there’s always a tether. Something that finds me getting to where I dream of in life and it sees that. It knows that I'm feeling happiness and it finds its way and pulls me back, scraping my dug-in fingernails until there's nothing left and it's content knowing I'm no better off.</p>
            <p>I've been so tired for so fucking long. I’m too exhausted to sleep. I haven’t been able to fall asleep sober in close to 6 months. I’ve given so much of myself that wasn’t there to absolutely anyone who needed it. Ingrained in my nature is a relentless urge to help and support others but I can’t even to help myself.</p>
            <p>A non-secular, capitalist world is one I’ve come to learn that I can’t live in. There are no reasons for the suffering it causes. There is no reason for children to be torn from their parents’ care and placed respectively into cages and concentration camps under the guise of “protecting” people from those fearing for their own lives. There is no reason for vacant homes to outnumber the homeless.There is no reason for a young girl to have her genitals mutilated resulting in the inability to experience and embrace their natural sense of sexuality and be forced into a life of subservience to a man she doesn’t love. There is no reason for the planet that allows us life should be exponentially contorted into a death trap for nothing more than to line the pockets of oligarchs. There are no reasons we cannot simply love and care for each and every other person alive on our Earth other than greed, ego and the indoctrination of feigned ideologies whose practitioners will sit idly by allowing these atrocities to occur while condemning those who actually practice the same teachings their faiths preach, all while bannering themselves as exemplary figures in their communities.</p>
            <p>I hope. I hope so badly that there are those stronger than me, those who have the energy left to fight for the equality humanity deserves, the energy to educate, the energy to break through the deep-rooted walls of ignorance, those who recognize the fact that our consciousness alone is an enourmous anomoly that should not be squandered on a fucking genetic lottery and the preciousness of our collective existence should be easily recognized and appreciated by every human being, regardless of color, creed, gender, nationanitly or sexuality. </p>
            <p>In my past, I’ve damaged people emotionally, physically and psychologically. These actions and inactions are things that haunt me daily and wish as I may, I can’t go back and change those events. I am not one to intentionally hurt anyone. If I ever have, it was due to a lack of understanding that I was doing so.</p>
            <p>To anyone I’ve caused harm in any way, I care about you. I’m so incredibly sorry in ways that words cannot explain and can only hope you’ve found some way to heal any wounds I may have caused you.</p>
            <p>During my journeys, I’ve found so many people in life that have helped me, that have taught me what it is to love and to care, given me feelings of purpose and the incentives I needed to push through the hard points. want you to know that your contributions, sacrifices and generosities do not go unappreciated. Unfortunately, feelings apparently wane.</p>
            <p>I have tried so fucking hard. I truly have. I don’t want to cause anyone grief, but the stressors, anxieties, the complete disregard for others practiced by so many as if in their self-protagonistic story, their exploitation of others results in an absence of consequences, have whittled away at my soul, leaving a delicately balanced twig that has finally been brushed against to the point of dancing its closing sway.</p>
            <p>I thank you all. I love you.</p>
